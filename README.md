# Python Crash Course Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing projects inspired by the book *Python Crash Course, Third Edition* by Eric Matthes!
These projects are part of my journey to strengthen my Python skills and explore the fundamentals of programming.
Each project builds on concepts like data manipulation, user interaction, and creating functional applications.
